Membership App
=======

Decorator pattern practice

- Transform the code to use decorator pattern to decorate a membership with different benefits
- Create decorators for each different benefit
- Modify the code so that each benefit modifies the cost of the membership
- Make sure that checkstyle do not report any error at the end


NOTE: No unit tests are required for this practice
